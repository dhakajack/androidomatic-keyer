ANDROIDOMATIC KEYER RELEASE PROCESS
===================================

This process is the official way to push a new release of AKA to
Android Market; it's mostly concerned with signing the release with
the proper release-keys, which are required for publishing.

For experimental test releases (alphas, etc), no key-signing is
required.  Testers simply need to have their Android configured to
accept unsigned packages from 'unknown sources'.


1. Bump the version number

  In AndroidManifest.xml, bump the versionCode and versionName
  attributes.

  - versionCode is the one which really matters:  you MUST increase
    the integer monotonically.  This is what android Market looks at
    to notice that the new .apk is an 'upgrade' from the prior one.

  - versionName can be whatever we want (i.e. 1.2.6), and it's what we
    display to the user on startup.  In other words, this is 'public'
    release name.

  - for AKA, we're trying to keep these values relatively synced:
    versionName 1.0 == versionCode 10, versionName 1.1 == versionCode 11, etc.


2. Export an *unsigned* .apk from Eclipse.

  Right-click the project folder, then choose 'Android Tools->Export
  Unsigned Application Package".

  (Eclipse normally builds a 'debug' .apk which is signed by a
  standard lame debug-key.  Market will not accept this key signature;
  it requires a signature from key we generate ourselves.)


3. Sign the .apk with our own "official" developer private key.

  Make sure you have the shared AKA key (and password) available,
  (templaro.keystore) then run:

  $ jarsigner -verbose -keystore templaro.keystore AndroidomaticKeyer.apk templaro

  After signing, you can verify the sig:

  $ jarsigner -verify -verbose AndroidomaticKeyer.apk


4. Upload the new .apk to Google Code

  Use the 'Downloads' tab to upload the package.  Be sure to label the
  package as 'Featured' so it shows up on the front page, and label
  the old package as 'Deprecated' so it's not listed to the public
  anymore.


5. Upload the new .apk to Market

  Log into the 'templaroteam@gmail.com" GAIA account at
  market.android.com.  Upload the new .apk and 'publish' it.
